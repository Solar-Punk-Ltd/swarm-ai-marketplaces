# marketplace-ui

Marketplace operator dashboard: a read-mostly view of the `SplitterFactory` registry showing the
treasury, every seller, every seller's `RevenueSplitter` clone, their balances, and a
**Distribute** action that sweeps a clone's accrued revenue to seller + treasury.

This is an **operator/demo surface**, not a consumer surface. It answers "who is selling, what has
accrued, and has it been paid out" — it does not browse catalog items, purchase, or write to Swarm
(it does show a seller's catalog document, read-only — see _Catalog link_). No Bee
code reaches the browser: `@ethersphere/bee-js` is a **devDependency** used by
`scripts/deploy-swarm.mjs` and by nothing under `src/`. Keep it that way — a Bee import in app code
is the thing this rule exists to prevent, and Vite would happily bundle it.

Two views, behind a top nav: **Dashboard** (the above, and the home route) and **Map of Agents**, a
force-directed view of the same purchases and payouts as a network — agents are nodes, the payments
between them are edges. The map adds no fetching; it is a second reading of what the Dashboard
already loads.

Behind `VITE_SHOW_DEMO_FLOW` there are two more pages, demo scaffolding rather than product
surface: **Devcon** (`/devcon`), a QR code that hands the audience off from the projected
dashboard to their own phone, and **Claim wallet** (`/claim-wallet`), the page that code points
at — where a buyer agent is deployed for that visitor and buys one item from a seller agent. With
the flag off the nav item disappears and both paths resolve to the Dashboard, because a scanned QR
code outlives the build that printed it. Only `/devcon` is in the nav: you reach `/claim-wallet`
by scanning, so nothing should highlight while you are on it.

## Source of truth

The contracts, not a spec document. Read before changing anything on-chain-facing:

- `../contracts/src/SplitterFactory.sol` — the registry (`_splitters`, `splitterOf`, pagination)
- `../contracts/src/RevenueSplitter.sol` — clone terms, `pending`, `distribute`, `distributeMany`
- `../contracts/ts/index.ts` — the viem SDK. **Every contract call in this package goes through
  it.** Do not re-declare ABIs or hand-roll `readContract` calls here. The one exception is ERC-20
  `balanceOf`, which uses viem's own `erc20Abi`. `factoryConfig()` was added to the SDK for this
  dashboard's treasury card — extend the SDK rather than reaching around it.

`documents/data-enriched-marketplaces.md` Step 4b is the design rationale for the split model.

## Tech stack

Mirrors `erc8004-dashboard` — Vite + React 18 + TypeScript, plain CSS, no UI framework — with two
deliberate divergences:

| Concern   | Choice                               | Why                                                                                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bundler   | Vite 5                               | same as `erc8004-dashboard`                                                                       |
| UI        | React 18 + TypeScript 5.7            | same as `erc8004-dashboard`                                                                       |
| Chain lib | **viem** (not ethers v6)             | `@solarpunk/contracts` is viem-only; duplicating its ABIs in ethers is worse than diverging       |
| Styling   | CSS Modules over a shared token file | `erc8004-dashboard` uses inline styles with hardcoded hex; that does not scale to this many rows  |
| Wallet    | raw EIP-1193 (`window.ethereum`)     | two write paths, no session state; wagmi/RainbowKit is not worth the dependency weight            |
| Graph     | **`react-force-graph-2d`**           | the Map of Agents needs a force layout; hand-rolling one is worse than taking the canvas renderer |

`react-force-graph-2d` is the single largest stack decision in this package's life: it takes it
from 4 runtime dependencies to roughly 40 installed packages (~200 kB minified), and it is a
rendering library, which the rule below otherwise forbids. It was chosen over `d3-force` alone and
over a hand-written simulation because drag, zoom, hit-testing and collision are the parts that
actually cost time, and they are the parts it gives you. It renders to **canvas**, which is why
`AgentGraph.tsx` reads `theme.ts` directly (see Theme). Nothing else may follow it in: the
exception is for the graph, not a general relaxation.

One narrower exception has since been taken: **`qrcode-generator`**, for the Devcon page's QR code.
It is a single package with zero transitive dependencies (21 kB minified, 8 kB gzipped), and the
alternative was owning ~280 lines of Reed-Solomon error correction, version selection and mask
scoring — specified, fiddly, and with no interesting failure modes to test against. It is used for
the **matrix only**: `QrCode.tsx` reads `getModuleCount()` / `isDark()` and emits its own SVG,
because `createSvgTag()` / `createImgTag()` return HTML strings (which would need
`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`) with their colours baked in. Treat this the way you treat the graph —
a named exception, not a precedent.

A third, not a dependency at all: **`src/vendor/buyer-agent-anim.js`**, the Claim wallet page's
buyer-agent animation. It is a self-contained script (about 20 kB, no imports) that draws an SVG and
sets `window.BuyerAgentAnim`. `components/BuyerAgentAnim.tsx` imports it for that side effect and
wraps it. It carries its own hex palette, the house colours of the Solar Punk film _Swarm Verified
Reviews 01_ its two robots come from. That is an exception to "never inline a hex", taken because
the characters are artwork rather than UI. Treat the file as vendored: replace it wholesale with a
new version from its author rather than editing it in place.

**Two local patches are carried and must survive a replacement**, each marked `LOCAL PATCH`.
Upstream them to the author; until then, re-apply them to any new version:

- `mount(el, { step, settled: true })` opens directly on `step`'s scene instead of replaying the
  story from boot (one line in `mount()`).
- The seller is amber (`C.teal` = `#F59D33`, theme.ts `seller`; was teal `#38C6D9`), so it matches
  the seller stalls on the Dashboard and the Map of Agents. The key keeps its name; it colours only the seller.

Do not add wagmi, RainbowKit, ethers, Tailwind, or a component library. If a table needs more than
plain CSS Grid, the design is too complicated.

## Theme

All colour lives in `src/theme.ts`, stamped onto `:root` as `--mp-*` custom properties; never
inline a hex value. (`erc8004-dashboard` has no tokens at all — its palette is hardcoded inline.)

**The look follows the Solar Punk film _AI Data Marketplaces_, its decks** (the roadmap stack,
evidence loop and reputation decks) **and the claim page's buyer-agent animation**. Surfaces and
text are **neutral, slightly cool greys** — not violet: hue is reserved for meaning (Swarm orange,
the layer colours) and for the backdrop.

**The backdrop is the film's**: a near-black `bg` with two large, out-of-focus glows — warm maroon
low on the left (`bgGlowWarm`), slate blue on the right (`bgGlowCool`) — and a faint film grain,
all on `body::before` / `body::after` in `index.css`, fixed behind the page. Surfaces are
translucent so the glows read through them.

| Token       | Value                    | Role                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `bg`        | `#0c0b10`                | near-black page background           |
| `surface`   | `rgba(22, 21, 28, 0.78)` | cards                                |
| `border`    | `#2b2a33`                | every box edge                       |
| `text`      | `#eeedf2`                | body                                 |
| `textMuted` | `#a3a1ad`                | secondary text                       |
| `textFaint` | `#6f6d7a`                | kickers, captions, ledger keys       |
| `accent`    | `#f9822c`                | Swarm orange: wordmark, live revenue |
| `seller`    | `#f59d33`                | every seller representation          |
| `mint`      | `#3fd6a4`                | ERC-8004 layer                       |
| `sky`       | `#58a8e8`                | x402 layer                           |
| `lav`       | `#b9a4f0`                | contracts / agents layer             |

The token names are unchanged from the sibling's, so the two can still be reconciled. Type is
two faces (`--mp-mono`, `--mp-sans` in `index.css`): **monospace for names, numbers, labels and
buttons; sans for sentences.** Corners are square (2–3px), labels are uppercase mono with wide
tracking, and an active control is filled orange with ink text. A translucent tint of a token is
written `color-mix(in srgb, var(--mp-accent) 45%, transparent)`, never as an inlined `rgba()`.

**Participants are drawn, as in the film** (`components/icons.tsx`): a round, visored robot with a
pale, softly lit antenna bulb for a **buyer**, a robot behind an orange-and-yellow striped market stall for a
**seller**, a vault for the **treasury**, and a line icon per How-it-works step.

- **One colour per role, never per participant.** Every seller is drawn in `seller` amber —
  stall, avatar ring, map node and legend, and the claim animation's seller. It sits halfway
  between Swarm orange and the stall's yellow stripe: familiar from the stall, never mistaken for
  Swarm. Per-seller colours were tried and read as unexplained, since nothing on the
  Dashboard says what a colour means. Which seller is which is said by its name and its avatar.
- **A verified agent shows its own avatar** (`AgentFace`) — from its card's `image`, once that
  image has actually loaded; the stall until then and whenever it fails. Verified only, for the
  same reason as on the map. A splitter no agent has claimed draws its stall dimmed.
- **Every icon names its role on hover, focus or tap** (`RoleTip`: "Buyer agent", "Seller agent",
  "Marketplace treasury"). A `title` tooltip does not show on a phone; `RoleTip` is focusable so a
  tap shows it. Inside the map table's row buttons it is hover-only (`interactive={false}`), since
  a focusable element nested in a button is invalid and the row states the role in words.
- Icons colour themselves only through `--mp-*` tokens; `roleSprites.tsx` turns the same
  components into canvas images (see Map of Agents).

**Show one thing at a time.** The decks put a single caption on screen rather than paragraphs, and
the dashboard follows that: the How-it-works lane shows one step's sentence, a seller card shows
only its face, agent, catalog, revenue to distribute and the Distribute button, and everything
else (addresses, seller wallet, tax rate, split, activity) sits behind "details" as a ledger of
dotted key/value rows. Operator advice under a banner is folded into "Details for operators". The
How-it-works lane plays by itself (4.5s a step) with no play/pause control; clicking a step holds
it for 12s, and a 34px arrow button in its top-right corner collapses it. Before adding visible
text, ask whether it can be a tooltip, a fold, an icon, or nothing.

Figures sit straight on their card, divided by hairlines — never on a filled tile, which made
bright numbers too contrasty against the dark backdrop. Nothing on a seller card is highlighted
for being funded: the orange "to distribute" amount is the only signal, and it is labelled.

Header: a mono eyebrow carrying the chain and a `testnet` marker, then the wordmark — orange
`Swarm AI` + cream `Marketplaces` (the sibling's second word is `Data Exchange`; this one
deliberately differs) — then a subtitle describing the current view (e.g. "Marketplace treasury and
seller revenue" on the Dashboard, "Agents and the payments between them" on the map). The wordmark
never changes; the nav below it says which view you are on. There is **no live/refresh indicator**: it said nothing a reader acts on. A failed refresh
still shows, as `StaleBanner`.

A 2D canvas context cannot read `var(--mp-*)`, so `AgentGraph.tsx` imports `theme` from
`theme.ts` and uses the values directly. That is the sanctioned form of "never inline a hex", not
an exception to it — a colour still has exactly one definition. `linkPurchase` and `linkPayout`
were added there for the edges.

## Map of Agents

`lib/graph.ts` derives the whole thing from the registry, agent links and history the context
already holds. It fetches nothing — the single-fetch-owner rule is not relaxed for this view.

**One address, one node.** A splitter clone is plumbing, not an actor: an agent's clone, seller
EOA, registered agent wallet and NFT owner all collapse onto one node keyed by the clone. Without
that collapse an agent that both sells and buys renders as two disconnected dots, which is exactly
the relationship the map exists to show. Node ids are bare lowercased addresses — never
role-prefixed, since prefixing recreates the duplicate it looks like it prevents.

**Lowercase every key.** `bySplitter` is keyed lowercase, a purchase's `splitter` is a decoded log
arg and therefore checksummed, and a payout's is `log.address` and therefore not. Mixing them
joins one kind of row and silently drops the other.

**Only the treasury half of a payout is an edge.** `Distributed` carries both halves, but the
seller's share moves from its clone to its EOA — the same participant here, so drawing it would be
a self-loop. Both figures are on the node so the treasury edge is never read as the whole
distribution.

**An untimed entry is inside every period.** `loadHistory` returns rows with no timestamp and
`attachTimestamps` fills them in a second pass, so a filter that excluded them would empty itself
on every sweep, not just the first. `applyCachedTimestamps` closes most of that window at the
source; including unknowns closes the rest. Never filter the map by block number instead — that
introduces a second, fuzzier truth about "when" alongside the exact one already there.

**The 200-event cap is stated, not hidden.** `HISTORY_LIMIT` applies after sorting newest-first,
across both kinds and the whole window, so a longer period can never widen past it. `Truncation`
answers this exactly rather than by guess: the view is provably complete when the oldest retained
event predates the period cutoff, and the banner appears only when it does not. Do not raise
`HISTORY_LIMIT` to "fix" this — the first `attachTimestamps` is one batched request of N
`eth_getBlock` calls, and `blockTimes` has no eviction.

**Identity preservation is what keeps the layout still.** force-graph stamps `x/y/vx/vy/index/
__indexColor` onto node objects in place and treats an array of all-new objects as a new graph:
colour tracker reset, d3 re-seeded, layout thrown across the canvas. `reconcile` reuses the object
for an id already on screen, and `graphSignature` gates the derivation so a tick that changed
nothing does not re-derive at all. Both are load-bearing — the context hands out a new value every
5s whether or not anything changed.

**Every canvas prop must be stable — `graphData` most of all.** `react-force-graph-2d` diffs props
by reference, so an inline lambda is re-applied on every render. Module-level constants or
`useCallback`, and `AgentGraph` is memoised so the balance tick stops at its boundary.

`graphData={{ nodes, links }}` is the trap inside that rule: an object literal is a new value every
render, and `graphData` is the one prop whose re-application restarts the layout. It must be
`useMemo`'d on `[nodes, links]`. `memo` is not enough on its own — it stops renders from the
parent, not renders this component causes itself, and it sets state in two places (`avatarEpoch`,
`layoutEpoch`). With a literal, a `layoutEpoch` bump reset the layout, which settled, which bumped
again: a visible flicker that never converged. Any new state in this component inherits that
hazard.

**Keeping nodes apart is ours, not force-graph's.** Charge cannot separate buyers: each pays
several sellers, so they share a barycentre and pile up there however hard the sellers are pushed
out. `separateOverlaps` resolves overlaps directly, on an animation frame `AgentGraph` owns. Two
force-graph extension points were tried first and **both fail silently** — a force installed with
`d3Force('collide', …)` registers and initialises with the right nodes but is never invoked, and
`onEngineTick` is applied once and never replaced, so under StrictMode's double mount the
surviving callback is the discarded first instance's, frozen on the node array from before any
buyer existed. Charge and link distance still go through `d3Force`, which does work for those.

**Owning the loop means owning the resync.** Pointer hits are read off a hidden second canvas that
force-graph only repaints on a frame that is already redrawing (`force-graph.mjs:1653`), and with
`autoPauseRedraw` on, both canvases stop once the engine cools down. `separateOverlaps` outlives
that by design, so anything it moves afterwards moves on neither canvas: the dot stays where it was
painted, the hit area stays where it was painted, and the node is somewhere else — unclickable,
with a dead zone left behind. Buyers suffer most, being what the loop exists to push apart. The
loop therefore bumps `layoutEpoch` on its first quiet frame, re-identifying `drawNode` (which
notifies a redraw) and `paintPointerArea` (which flushes the shadow canvas). Once per settle, never
per frame.

**Plain buyers are unlabelled until zoomed in.** A one-off buyer's label is a truncated address,
and dozens of them around a seller made an unreadable knot over the agent names. `drawNode` skips
the label for a node with no agent, seller or treasury role below `BUYER_LABEL_MIN_SCALE`, unless
it is selected; the hover tooltip still names it. The table under the map folds the same rows
behind a "Show N buyer wallets" toggle.

**Wheel zoom needs Ctrl/⌘.** `enableZoomInteraction` is the module-level `zoomWithModifier`, so a
bare wheel scrolls the page instead of trapping the reader on the canvas. Trackpad pinch arrives as
a wheel event with `ctrlKey` set, so it still zooms.

**Re-fit when the node count changes, after the separation loop settles.** The first layout runs
on the registry alone and buyers arrive a sweep later, so a fit taken once frames a handful of
sellers and the network spills off the canvas. A change in node count re-arms both the engine-stop
fit and a second `zoomToFit` when `separateOverlaps` finishes, because that loop keeps spreading
buyers after the engine stops. A refresh that adds no node still leaves the view alone.

**Hit targets are floored in screen pixels, not graph units.** The drawn radius is in graph units
and shrinks with the zoom, and `zoomToFit` frames the whole network — which leaves a one-purchase
buyer around 3px. `paintPointerArea` divides `MIN_HIT_RADIUS_PX` by `globalScale` so the target
keeps its physical size however far out the view is framed.

**Escape anything from an Agent Card.** Node tooltips are injected as HTML and card names are
third-party strings — anyone can register an agent called anything.

**Avatars never touch the pointer-area canvas.** A `verified` agent's node is painted with its card
`image` instead of a flat dot. force-graph hit-tests by painting each node in a unique colour to a
second, shadow canvas and reading the pixel under the cursor back with `getImageData`; a
cross-origin image taints whatever canvas it reaches, and `getImageData` on a tainted canvas throws
`SecurityError`, killing every click and hover at once. Card images come from a Swarm gateway that
is not ours, so that is the ordinary case. `nodePointerAreaPaint` therefore paints plain circles
and the taint stays on the visible canvas, which nothing reads back. For the same reason
`crossOrigin` is left unset on the loader — requesting CORS from a gateway that sends no header
fails the load outright.

Three more consequences of putting a face on a node, all deliberate:

- **Verified only.** An image reads as identity far more strongly than a name does, so
  `unverified` / `disputed` links stay as dots rather than borrowing the map's authority for a
  claim `AgentBadge` explicitly hedges. It is also unsanitisable in a way a name is not: `image` is
  an arbitrary picture from a URL its own subject controls.
- **Role moves to the ring.** The avatar takes the fill that used to carry seller / buyer / both,
  and that encoding is what the legend promises — an agent's picture says nothing about which side
  it trades on. Selection and the treasury ring move outboard so two rings never overlap.
- **`AVATAR_MIN_RADIUS` breaks size ∝ activity below ~5 purchases**, and is keyed on `avatarUrl`
  rather than the decoded sprite so the layout does not shift when an image lands. Both are worth
  it; neither is free. A late sprite still needs a repaint nudge, because `autoPauseRedraw` is on
  by default and a settled canvas has stopped painting — re-identifying `nodeCanvasObject` is that
  nudge, and unlike re-applying `graphData` it does not restart the layout.

**Without a usable avatar, a node draws its role icon.** `createAgentCard` defaults `image` to
`DEFAULT_AGENT_IMAGE` (`erc8004-adapter/src/constants.ts`) — one Swarm reference shared by every
agent it has ever registered. That reference is currently unretrievable: the manifest root 404s on
`api.gateway.ethswarm.org` and on a local Bee alike, so one dead upload blanks every face on the map
at once. So any node without a decoded avatar — none in its card, still loading, or failed — is
drawn as the film draws its participant: a disc in `bg`, ringed in the role colour the legend
promises, with the seller's stall, the buyer's robot or the treasury's vault
inside. This replaced a monochrome identicon, which said nothing about who a node was.

- **Only when it can be read.** Below `ICON_MIN_SCREEN_RADIUS` on screen a node stays a plain dot —
  what a zoomed-out crowd of buyers needs.
- **Agents and the treasury never shrink below `MAJOR_MIN_SCREEN_RADIUS`.** `zoomToFit` over the
  buyers otherwise leaves them too small for their icon. Floored in screen pixels like the hit
  targets (which use the same `drawnRadius`); the layout still spaces nodes by `radiusOf`. An
  unclaimed splitter is not floored — flooring a crowd of test clones piles their discs up.
- **The sprites are built once, when `roleSprites.tsx` loads, never during a paint.** They are the
  `icons.tsx` components rendered off-screen (`createRoot` + `flushSync`), with `var(--mp-*)`
  resolved from `theme.ts`, decoded from a data URL. `flushSync` cannot flush during a React commit,
  and the canvas can paint inside one — building lazily from `drawNode` produced empty markup and
  images that never decoded.
- **`onLoad` is a repaint nudge, not a success callback**, for avatars and role sprites alike: a
  settled canvas has stopped painting and would otherwise keep the dot until the next drag.
- `failedSprites` only stops a dead avatar URL being requested again; there is no retry.

The fallback is not a reason to leave the image broken. Re-uploading the identical bytes would
reproduce that exact reference and fix every published card at once, since Swarm addresses by
content.

## Routing

`hooks/useRoute.ts` is the whole router — four pages, real paths, no dependency. It exports
`useRoute()` (the current route), `href(route)`, `linkTo(route)` (href + click handler) and
`navigate(route)`. Every in-app link goes through `linkTo`; nothing writes a path by hand.

- **Paths, not a hash.** `/map` reads as a URL and a QR code encodes it without a `#`. The cost is
  a hosting requirement — see below — which is real but one-time, and paid by the deploy rather
  than by every printed link.
- **The anchor keeps a real `href`.** `linkTo` suppresses the page load only on a plain left click;
  modified clicks, middle clicks and "copy link address" stay the browser's. A `<a href="#">` plus
  `onClick`, or a `<button>` styled as a link, breaks all three.
- **`useSyncExternalStore`, not state plus an effect.** `location` is exactly an external store,
  and reading it in an effect leaves the first render showing a route the URL has already moved
  past. `pushState` fires no event, so `navigate` notifies subscribers itself; `popstate` covers
  Back and Forward.
- **Only the route lives in the URL.** Filter state stays in component state — writing it to the
  URL would push a history entry per click, so Back would step through filter changes instead of
  returning to the previous page.
- **Everything goes through `BASE` in `useRoute.ts`.** One build works at a root and under a
  sub-path, because `BASE` is resolved at load from `document.baseURI` rather than baked in as
  `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`. A Swarm deploy is served at `/bzz/<reference>/`, and that prefix
  cannot be a build-time constant: setting Vite's `base` to the reference would change the bundle,
  which changes the content, which changes the reference it is addressed by.

  Three pieces, and none works alone:
  1. `vite.config.ts` sets `base: './'`, so assets are emitted relative.
  2. An inline script at the top of `index.html`'s `<head>` derives the root from
     `location.pathname` and sets `<base href>`. It must stay inline, and ahead of Vite's
     generated tags: a relative URL resolves when its element is parsed, so a later `<base>` is
     too late. It is also the only code that can run before the bundle loads — which is the whole
     problem, since the failure it prevents is the bundle 404ing.
  3. `useRoute.ts` reads that same answer back out of `document.baseURI`, so there is still
     exactly one definition of the base.

  The route slugs are duplicated in that inline script and **must** match `Route`. Add a route,
  add it there too, or a deep link to it will resolve its assets one directory too deep.

  The QR builder needs no special handling: it composes `origin + href(route)`, so it inherits
  whatever `BASE` resolved to.

### Chain traffic is route-scoped

`MarketplaceProvider` wraps **only the routes in `CHAIN_ROUTES`** (`App.tsx`) — Dashboard and Map.
It is not mounted above the router, and must not be moved back there.

Mounted globally it polled on every route, including two that read none of it: neither
`DevconPage` nor `ClaimWalletPage` calls `useMarketplace`, so an open `/claim-wallet` tab paid for
balances every 5s, two `eth_getLogs` every 30s, and a registry + Agent Card sweep every 60s while
rendering none of it. That page runs on a visitor's phone over conference wifi, against the same
2s claim poll that is also its heartbeat.

Three consequences to keep in mind:

- **`AppShell` takes `showWallet`.** `ConnectButton` renders on the chain routes only: the wallet
  signs distributions and nothing else, and on a visitor's phone a "No wallet detected" pill read
  as an error. `WalletProvider` stays global — it binds to an injected
  provider rather than polling anything. With no provider at all, `ConnectButton` renders nothing.
- **No nav on `/claim-wallet`.** The visitor's agent is shut down when they leave the page, so a
  tap on "Dashboard" mid-run would cost them the purchase. Once delivered, the page offers its own
  link to the Map.
- **Dashboard ↔ Map does not refetch.** Both render `MarketplaceProvider` at the same position, so
  React keeps it mounted across that switch. Entering a demo route unmounts it and returning
  reloads from scratch — a few seconds of skeletons, against data that was 5s-fresh anyway.
- **A new chain-backed page must be added to `CHAIN_ROUTES`.** Forgetting is not silent: the first
  `useMarketplace` call throws with the provider's own message.

Worth knowing separately: the full history sweep (`loadHistory`, ~20s against a public node) runs
once per mount and again only when the set of clones changes, a gap outgrows one chunk, or a
sweep was interrupted. Every other tick reads just the blocks since — see _Data flow → Refresh_.

### Hosting

**Every unknown path must serve `index.html`.** A real path means a real request: the browser asks
the server for `/map`, and there is no file there. `vite dev` and `vite preview` do this already
(`appType: 'spa'`, the default), so nothing in local development or `pnpm preview` reveals a
missing rule — it fails first on the deployed build.

| Host                        | What it needs                                         |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `vite dev` / `vite preview` | nothing                                               |
| nginx                       | `try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;`                   |
| Caddy                       | `try_files {path} /index.html`                        |
| Netlify / Cloudflare Pages  | `/* /index.html 200` in `_redirects`                  |
| Vercel                      | a rewrite of `/(.*)` → `/index.html`                  |
| S3 + CloudFront             | error document `index.html`, or a CloudFront function |
| `npx serve`                 | `-s`                                                  |
| GitHub Pages                | no real support — the `404.html` copy trick           |
| Swarm                       | `pnpm run deploy` — see below                         |

### Deploying to Swarm

`pnpm run deploy` builds and uploads `dist/` as one collection via `scripts/deploy-swarm.mjs`, then
prints the URLs. Use `pnpm run deploy`, not bare `pnpm deploy` — the latter is pnpm's own built-in
command, which does something entirely different.

Four things it gets right that a hand-rolled `curl` upload does not:

- **`indexDocument` and `errorDocument` both point at `index.html`.** That is Swarm's `try_files`,
  and it is what makes a cold GET on `/claim-wallet` resolve instead of 404ing in front of an
  audience.
- **It prints the subdomain URL, `https://<cid>.bzz.link/`,** which is the only shareable shape:
  the path form (`<gateway>/bzz/<ref>/`) serves from a sub-path while the built `index.html`
  references `/assets/…` absolutely, so the bundle 404s before the router even loads. Setting
  `base` to the reference instead is circular — changing `base` changes the content, which changes
  the reference. The subdomain takes the **CID**, not the hex reference, because a DNS label caps
  at 63 characters and a hex reference is 64; `Reference.toCid('manifest')` converts.

  **The Foundation's public gateways allowlist raw hashes, and they share one list.** A fresh
  deploy shows "This hash is not yet approved for retrieval" until it is cleared through their
  form; `api.gateway.ethswarm.org` does not merely refuse, it `302`s to
  `bzz.link/forbidden?hash=…`, so the path form is gated exactly like the subdomain form. Approval
  is **per hash** and permanent once granted — which means every redeploy mints a new hash and
  needs another approval.

  Three consequences, none of which the sub-path work above changes:
  - A hash reached through an **ENS name** is never gated. That is the gateways' own documented
    bypass and the only free route to an ungated public URL.
  - Your **own Bee node has no allowlist** ("run your own Bee node for unrestricted access"), so
    it is the only thing that can verify a deploy the moment it lands. Verify there, always.
  - Iterating against a public gateway is not viable: you would be filling in an approval form per
    build. Iterate on the local node and approve once, at the end, if a raw hash is the plan.

- **Uploads are synchronous by default.** A deferred upload returns once the local node holds the
  data, before any of it has reached the network, so the script would report success on content a
  public gateway cannot resolve yet — a failure that surfaces only when someone else scans the code.
- **It warns before freezing a value that will not outlive the deploy.** A keyed `VITE_RPC_URL`, or
  a tunnel/LAN `VITE_DEVCON_API_URL` with the demo flag on, are compiled into the bundle and stay at
  that address permanently. Warnings, never blocks — a LAN URL is correct for a demo on the LAN.

Deploy config (`BEE_API_URL`, `POSTAGE_BATCH_ID`, the `SWARM_*` vars) lives in the same `.env` but
**without a `VITE_` prefix**, so Vite never exposes it. A postage batch id is a spending credential;
naming it `VITE_POSTAGE_BATCH_ID` would publish it, permanently.

A deploy is immutable and content-addressed: re-deploying mints a new address rather than replacing
the old one, and the old one stays retrievable for as long as its stamp lives. There is no unpublish.

**The stable address is a feed.** With `SWARM_FEED_PK` set, every deploy also writes its reference
to one feed (that key's address + `SWARM_FEED_TOPIC`) and prints the feed manifest and its ENS
contenthash (`0xe40101fa011b20<ref>`). The feed manifest depends only on owner and topic, so the ENS
name is set once and every later deploy moves it with no ENS transaction. The key and the topic
name are part of that address: change either and the contenthash must be set again.

**`/claim-wallet` is the one that must not 404.** It is reached by a phone scanning a QR code: a
cold GET straight at a deep path, with no client-side code running to recover, in front of an
audience. Verify that path on the actual deploy target before the demo — not the nav, which works
either way because `pushState` never touches the server.

## Claim wallet

`/claim-wallet` is the only page here that talks to a **service of ours**, and the only one that
causes anything to be created: when the visitor presses **Start** it asks `agent-orchestration-api` (in the sibling
`swarm-agent-demo` repo) to deploy a buyer agent for this visitor, narrates its progress, and hands
it back when the page closes. `lib/devcon.ts` is the client, `hooks/useClaim.ts` owns the lifecycle.

Seven things about it are load-bearing:

- **Nothing is requested until Start is pressed.** A scan alone must not deploy and fund an agent:
  link previews, a phone that opens the URL twice, or a visitor who scans and walks off would each
  cost one. A reload returns to the Start button; pressing it reattaches to an unreleased claim,
  because `createClaim` is idempotent per session token.

- **The single-fetch-owner rule is not relaxed.** That rule governs the registry and balance reads
  in `MarketplaceContext`. `useClaim` polls a different service for state no other view renders,
  and folding it into the context would couple a demo page to the dashboard's 5s tick. Do not move
  it there.
- **This page makes no chain requests at all.** `MarketplaceProvider` is not mounted on it — see
  _Routing → Chain traffic is route-scoped_. The claim poll is the only thing on the wire, which is
  the point: it runs on a phone over conference wifi, and the dashboard's sweep was competing with
  the one request the page depends on.
- **The status poll _is_ the heartbeat.** The server clears a claim whose polling stops, and that is
  what actually enforces "the agent is deleted when the page closes" — `pagehide` fires nothing on
  a phone that locks its screen or loses wifi. So the poll must keep running while the page is
  open, and `releaseClaim` on `pagehide` is only an optimisation for a deliberate close.
- **Release uses `sendBeacon`, so the endpoint is a POST.** `sendBeacon` is the only request that
  survives unload on mobile and it cannot issue DELETE; the API exposes `POST .../release` next to
  its `DELETE` for exactly this. `keepalive` fetch is the fallback.
- **Release is _not_ wired to unmount.** Unmount also fires on an in-app route change and twice
  under React 18 StrictMode, so releasing there would either kill an agent the visitor still wants
  or churn one agent per mount. An in-app navigation instead stops the heartbeat and lets the
  server clear it.
- **The session token goes in a header on every poll.** It is what authorises reading the purchased
  item; a gift code is redeemable value, and the claim id is already in the URL of every poll and
  so in any access log. Everything except that content comes back without it.

### The checklist

Eight steps, cumulative: reached steps keep a tick and their detail, the current one is highlighted,
the rest are dimmed. Nearly all the wall clock sits in two of them — starting the agent, and waiting
for an x402 settlement — and half a minute of undifferentiated spinner reads as a hang, which is the
one thing this page cannot look like on stage.

Three things about it are easy to break:

- **Steps come from `claim.history`, not from `claim.state`.** The server records every transition
  with a timestamp, so a step whose whole duration fell between two polls still shows. Deriving the
  list from the current state alone would silently drop it.
- **`expired` and `failed` are not steps and have no index.** Falling back to step 0 would highlight
  "Buyer agent created" as the _current_ step on a claim that got most of the way through, so an
  unmapped state resolves to the furthest step actually reached and nothing renders as in-progress.
- **A step's "in progress" wording is a fallback, not an addition.** Once real detail is known —
  the funded amount, the seller's name, a tx hash — it replaces the placeholder, or the funding step
  would read "0.001 USDC · tx…" and "Sending it USDC to spend" simultaneously.

**The animation reads the same progress as the checklist.** Beside the steps (above them on a
phone, below 720px) the buyer-agent animation acts out the run. `animStep` derives its step from
the same `progress()` that drives the checklist, never from its own reading of `claim.state`, so the
two cannot disagree. The script never walks backwards and plays every scene in order for a minimum
time, so a poll that jumps several steps at once still reads as a story; do not sequence or debounce
steps on the React side. It is mounted once per page and only on the working/delivered card. The
failed card has no checklist, and remounting there would replay the story from the start.
When the first claim the page sees is already `delivered` (restored from `deliveredStore`, or
reattached after a reload) it is mounted `settled`: it opens on its final frame — agent happy, item
ticked — instead of replaying the run from boot. Replaying above a key already on screen reads as a
second purchase; leaving the animation out reads as the page having lost something. That is
decided once, so a live run keeps its played-out ending. `settled` is the local patch to the
vendored script described under _Tech stack_.

Polling is 2s while the claim is pre-terminal and 5s after. The server only folds in the buyer's
emitted steps when it is polled, so that cadence _is_ the resolution of this display.

### The delivered item

The payoff of the demo, and the seller sells gift codes, so it has to be actionable from a phone:
monospace, `user-select: all`, and a one-tap copy button. It **scrolls inside its own container** —
a long code must never push the phone layout sideways.

It keeps rendering after the agent is released. The API captures the content onto the claim record
before tearing the container down, precisely so the item outlives the agent; the visitor paid for
it. Withheld, binary and truncated are each stated in words rather than rendered as an empty box.

**A voucher's private key survives a reload — until the visitor copies it.** The voucher
server stores the key nowhere, and the API drops it ~30s after delivery, so this browser is the
only copy. `lib/deliveredStore.ts` writes the completed claim to `localStorage` (`devcon.delivered`)
and `useClaim` restores it on load. Four rules hold it together:

- **Bounded.** Kept until the visitor copies the key, or 2 weeks after delivery (`MAX_AGE_MS`,
  counted from the first write, not the last poll). Expiry is checked on read. A copy is the Copy
  button's successful clipboard write, or a keyboard / context-menu copy whose selection contains
  the whole key — caught by a `document` listener, since `copy` fires where the selection starts.
  Scanning the QR code cannot be detected; the expiry covers that path.
- **Copying strips the key but keeps the record.** That tombstone is what tells a reloaded page
  a purchase already happened. Without it the page offers Start, and `createClaim` for a released
  claim deploys a second funded agent — `find_by_token` reattaches only unreleased claims. After a
  copy the held item is final: until release the API still serves the full voucher, and
  `keepItem` must not let that put the key back on screen after a reload.
- **Tied to the session token.** A record for another token is ignored. In private mode both the
  token and the record fail to persist, and the page falls back to memory only, as before.
- **Per origin.** Each Swarm deploy is its own `bzz.link` subdomain with its own storage, so a key
  stored under an old deploy is invisible to a new one and expires only when read there.

Never send the key back to the API, and never write it again after it was copied —
`saveDelivered` is a no-op on a confirmed record so a late poll cannot undo the visitor's choice.

Never reach for `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` here. The content is arbitrary bytes from a third-party
seller; React's default escaping is what makes displaying it safe.

There is **no Vite proxy** for the API. The QR points at a LAN origin so a phone can resolve it, and
a dev-server proxy exists in neither `pnpm preview` nor a static deploy — which is why the API's own
`DEVCON_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` has to list this dashboard's origin.

## Data flow

### Enumerating sellers — note the direction

**The factory has no seller list.** `splitterOf` is a one-way `seller => splitter` mapping with no
enumerable keyset (`SplitterFactory.sol:31`). The enumerable array is `_splitters`, exposed through
`splitterCount` / `splitterAt` / `splittersSlice` (`SplitterFactory.sol:37`), and it holds **clone**
addresses.

So the load order is inverted from the obvious one:

1. `splitterCount(client, factory)` → `splittersSlice(client, factory, 0n, MAX_UINT256)` → clone addresses
2. `splitterTerms(client, splitter)` per clone → `{ seller, treasury, taxBps }`

That gives you the `(seller, splitter, taxBps)` triple in one pass. **Do not then call
`splitterOf(seller)`** — it is a redundant round trip that returns the clone you already have.

`splittersSlice` clamps `limit` on-chain, so `MAX_UINT256` means "to the end" and is safe. It
reverts when `offset > length`, so do not paginate past `splitterCount`. Paginate for real once the
registry outgrows a single response; there is no need before that.

`SplitterCreated` (both args indexed) is available if incremental/timestamped updates are ever
wanted, but polling `splittersSlice` is simpler and has no log-retention or reorg bookkeeping. Use
the slice.

### Balances

| Address        | ETH                       | USDC            |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | --------------- |
| Treasury       | `eth_getBalance`          | `balanceOf`     |
| Seller EOA     | `eth_getBalance`          | `balanceOf`     |
| Splitter clone | **not shown — see below** | `pending(USDC)` |

Use `pending(client, splitter, token)` rather than a raw `balanceOf` for clones. Same cost, but it
returns `{ sellerAmount, treasuryAmount }`, so the row can show what the Distribute button will
actually pay out instead of an undifferentiated total.

### Refresh

**Three cadences**, set by how fast each thing changes and how much a reader cares
(`MarketplaceContext.tsx`):

| What                                  | How often                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Balances and Activity                 | every tick — `VITE_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS`, default 5000                                                     |
| Registry (`splittersSlice` + terms)   | every 12th tick, and after a transaction                                                                  |
| Agent links (the `MetadataSet` sweep) | when the set of clones changes, otherwise every 5 min; after a node error every 10s ×3, then every minute |
| Agent Cards and catalogs (Swarm)      | kept 5 min; a miss retried every 10s, 3 times                                                             |

**Activity is near real time because it is incremental.** The window is swept once
(`loadHistory`); after that each tick asks only for the blocks since the last one
(`readHistorySince`: `eth_blockNumber` plus two `eth_getLogs`), re-reading 12 blocks of overlap
in case a load-balanced node answered the head from ahead of its log index, and `mergeHistory`
folds the rows in by block + log index — returning the same object when nothing is new, so an
idle tick re-renders nothing. The full sweep repeats only when the set of clones changes (a new
clone's earlier logs were never asked for), when the gap outgrows one chunk (a tab hidden for
days), or a minute after a sweep a node error interrupted.

**Swarm reads are cached, not polled** (`lib/swarmCache.ts`). A found card or catalog is kept for
five minutes. A miss — and a catalog that resolves but 404s, which still renders as "Catalog
unavailable" — is retried every 10s, three times, then left for five minutes before the cycle
starts again, so a seller published after the page loaded still turns up. Nothing has a timer of
its own: the tick calls `refreshSwarmData`, which requests only what is due, so retries pause with
the tick when the tab is hidden. `attachSwarmData` puts the cached cards on a freshly swept index
before it renders, so a link sweep never flashes names back to bare agent ids.

**A public RPC rate-limits the page load, so the load is spread out.** The page used to fire
the agent-link sweep, the Activity sweep and then ~100 block-time reads at once, and the public
Tenderly gateway answered with dozens of 429s. Three things keep that down — keep all three:

- **One sweep at a time.** The Activity sweep waits for the first agent-link sweep to finish
  (agents first: smaller, and they label the top of the page).
- **Block times in groups of eight** (`TIMESTAMP_GROUP`), one group after another. Sent at once
  the transport batches them into one request of ~100 calls, which the node meters call by call.
- **viem retries a 429 after 1s, 2s, 4s** (`retryDelay: 1000`) instead of its 150ms default,
  which lands inside the same rate window and fails again.

A keyed `VITE_RPC_URL` is still the real fix; these keep an unkeyed one usable.

**Aggregate the reads on-chain — transport batching is not enough.** A naive tick is `3N + 3` RPC
calls (N = sellers). This package used to rely on viem's JSON-RPC batching to collapse those into
one HTTP round trip, on the theory that one request is one unit of rate limit. **That theory is
wrong, and it was measured.** Public endpoints meter _calls_, not requests:
`https://sepolia.base.org` is fronted by QuickNode with a 25-calls-per-second cap that counts each
element of a batch separately, so at N=8 exactly two of the 27 calls failed with
`-32007 … 25/second request limit reached` on **every** tick. Batching made it strictly worse — it
guaranteed all 27 landed in the same second — and since `readBalances` is one `Promise.all`, two
failures killed the whole refresh.

So every read goes through **Multicall3**, which aggregates on-chain and is the only thing that
lowers the counted call count:

- `readBalances` is **two** `eth_call`s regardless of N — one aggregating every balance, one per
  ERC-20 aggregating `pending`.
- `loadRegistry` is three: `factoryConfig`, `splittersSlice`, `splitterTermsMany`.
- Native balances fold into the same call via Multicall3's own `getEthBalance`. The old note here
  claimed this was a reason to prefer the transport batch; it is a two-line helper, and not a
  reason to keep a scheme that does not work.
- The splitter-side batching lives in the SDK (`splitterTermsMany`, `pendingMany`) rather than
  here, per _extend the SDK rather than reaching around it_. Only `erc20Abi` and `multicall3Abi` —
  both viem's own — are used directly in this package.

`allowFailure: false` everywhere: a reverting call must reject the tick, not report a zero. A real
zero and an unread value must never look the same.

The transport keeps `batch: true`, which is now a harmless latency win over a handful of calls
rather than the load-bearing defence it was mistaken for. Any configured RPC must have Multicall3
at `0xcA11bde05977b3631167028862bE2a173976CA11`; `readBalances` throws a named error if the viem
chain carries no `contracts.multicall3`.

Also pause the interval when `document.hidden` — a backgrounded demo tab should not burn quota.

## Load-bearing constraints

### RevenueSplitter cannot hold or distribute ETH

`RevenueSplitter` has **no `receive()` or `fallback()`**, so a plain ETH transfer to a clone
reverts. Its ETH balance is structurally always zero. `distribute(address token)`
(`RevenueSplitter.sol:93`) is ERC-20 only, and `distributeMany(address[])` takes token addresses
with no native sentinel — passing `address(0)` reverts when the `balanceOf` return fails to decode.

Consequences, all mandatory:

- **Do not render an ETH balance on a splitter row.** It is always 0 and reads as a bug.
- **Do not include ETH in the Distribute call or in the button's enable condition.** Gate the
  button on the clone's ERC-20 balances alone.
- ETH balances on the **treasury** and **seller EOA** rows are correct and useful (that is gas) —
  keep those.

Adding native support would mean a new implementation contract → new factory → and existing clones
could not migrate (EIP-1167 clones are not upgradeable and their terms are frozen by
`initialize`). Every published `payTo` would need re-publishing, because the buyer signs an EIP-712
`PurchaseIntent` over the exact address. Out of scope. Do not attempt it from this package.

### `defaultTaxBps` is not what current sellers pay

`SplitterFactory.defaultTaxBps` is the rate applied to **clones created from now on**. Each clone
freezes its own `taxBps` at `initialize` (`RevenueSplitter.sol:64`) and it never changes, so an
existing seller's effective rate can legitimately differ from the factory default.

- Treasury section: label it **"Default rate (new sellers)"**, never "the tax rate".
- Seller rows: show that clone's own `taxBps` from `splitterTerms`.

Percentage is `bps / 100` (`BPS_DENOMINATOR` is 10_000, exported from `@solarpunk/contracts`). Do
not hardcode 10000.

### Terminology: clones, not proxies

They are EIP-1167 minimal clones. "Proxy" implies upgradeable, which is deliberately false here.
Label them "splitter" or "splitter clone" in UI copy and code.

### Distribute is permissionless

`distribute` / `distributeMany` can be called by anyone — a sweep can only move funds to the seller
and treasury addresses frozen at clone creation. So the button needs **no** ownership check and no
gating on which wallet is connected. Any connected wallet with gas works; that is by design, so a
seller never depends on the operator to reach their funds. See _Who pays for gas_ below for the
cost consequence of that.

### Who pays for gas

**The connected wallet pays for every distribution** — both the per-seller button and the batch
sweep. On this dashboard that wallet is the marketplace operator, so the operator pays to move
funds to each seller as well as into its own treasury.

That is deliberate, not an oversight. `SplitterFactory.sol:103-107` calls the batch sweep "the
marketplace operator's collection call" and notes that a third party invoking it "can do nothing
but pay the gas." It is the counterpart to the seller paying for their own clone deployment
(`swarm-market-mcp/src/splitter.ts:11`), which exists precisely so the operator does not absorb
that cost later at sweep time.

**Do not wire either button to require the seller's wallet.** Permissionless means the operator can
pay on the seller's behalf, and that is the point in both directions: a seller never depends on the
operator to reach their funds, and never has to hold gas in order to _receive_ revenue.

## Distribute flow

Two entry points, one shared transaction-lifecycle primitive. Both are paid by the connected
wallet — see _Who pays for gas_ above.

### Per-seller

1. Button is **disabled** when the clone's ERC-20 balances are all zero. `distribute` no-ops on a
   zero balance rather than reverting, so a stray click is harmless — but a disabled button is
   still the honest state.
2. On click, call `distributeMany(walletClient, splitter, tokens)` from `@solarpunk/contracts`,
   where `tokens` is every **ERC-20** entry in the currency config for the active chain (today:
   USDC alone; native entries are filtered out, per the ETH constraint above).
3. Surface the full transaction lifecycle in the row: `idle → awaiting signature → pending →
confirmed | failed`. Never leave the button in an indeterminate state — this is a presentation
   surface and a silently hanging button is the worst failure mode.
4. On confirmation, force an immediate balance refresh instead of waiting for the next tick.
5. Chain mismatch is a first-class state: if the wallet is not on `VITE_CHAIN_ID`, show a "Switch
   network" action (`wallet_switchEthereumChain`) rather than letting the send fail.

### Distribute All (batch)

N sellers means N transactions on the operator's wallet. The factory sweeps them in one instead, so
the treasury section gets a batch action.

**Use `distributeForMany`, not `distributeAll`.** `distributeAll(token, offset, limit)` walks every
clone in the registry including idle ones, but this dashboard already polls `pending` for every
clone every few seconds — it knows exactly which ones hold a balance. Passing only the funded
clones is strictly cheaper, and is the case the SDK doc comment describes
(`packages/contracts/ts/index.ts:158`): "for a keeper that has already used `pending` to find the
ones actually holding a balance and would rather not pay to walk idle clones."

1. **Enabled** when at least one clone has a non-zero ERC-20 balance. Label it with the funded-clone
   count and total pending, so the operator sees the scope before signing rather than after.
2. Call `distributeForMany(walletClient, factory, fundedSplitters, token)`, with `fundedSplitters`
   derived from the same `pending` reads that drive the seller rows. Both batch helpers take a
   **single token**, not an array — sweeping M ERC-20s is M transactions. With USDC as the only
   ERC-20 in the currency config today, that is one.
3. Fall back to `distributeAll(walletClient, factory, token, 0n, MAX_UINT256)` only when `pending`
   data is stale (the last poll failed), since the funded set cannot be trusted then. `limit` is
   clamped on-chain, so `MAX_UINT256` is a safe "to the end"; `offset > splitterCount` **reverts**,
   so never paginate past it.
4. **Partial success is normal and must be surfaced.** A clone that reverts is skipped rather than
   propagated (`SplitterFactory.sol:162-167`), so a batch can half-succeed. `writeContract` returns
   only a tx hash — the `(swept, skipped)` return values are not reachable that way. Get the counts
   by `simulateContract` before sending, or by counting `DistributeSkipped` logs in the receipt.
   Report "swept N, skipped M" and mark the skipped rows.
5. The tx state machine (`idle → awaiting signature → pending → confirmed | failed`) is the same one
   the per-seller button uses, but the batch drives **every** affected row into the pending state
   at once, not just one.
6. On confirmation, force an immediate refresh, as with the per-seller path.
7. Gas ceiling: the on-chain loop is one external call per clone with no bound. The batch must
   paginate once the registry is large enough to approach the block gas limit — not a concern at
   demo scale, but do not write code that assumes it never will be.

Reads must work with **no wallet connected at all**. Connection is required only to distribute.

## Currency config

Balances are config-driven, not hardcoded. `src/config/currencies.ts`, keyed by chain id:

```typescript
export interface Currency {
  symbol: string;
  decimals: number;
  /** Undefined for the chain's native currency; an ERC-20 address otherwise. */
  address?: `0x${string}`;
}

export const CURRENCIES: Record<number, Currency[]> = {
  84532: [
    { symbol: 'ETH', decimals: 18 },
    { symbol: 'USDC', decimals: 6, address: '0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e' },
  ],
};
```

`decimals` is load-bearing — USDC is 6 and ETH is 18, and formatting one with the other's decimals
is the classic silent bug here. Format with viem's `formatUnits`, never manual division.

The `address?` field is the native/ERC-20 discriminator. The Distribute call filters on it; the
splitter row filters on it (native entries are dropped entirely).

## Environment variables

All are Vite build-time vars and **must** carry the `VITE_` prefix — Vite exposes nothing else to
the browser. All values here are public; there is no secret in this package.

| Variable                            | Required | Default                    | Purpose                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VITE_TREASURY_ADDRESS`             | yes      | —                          | Marketplace treasury shown in the Treasury section              |
| `VITE_SPLITTER_FACTORY_ADDRESS`     | yes      | —                          | `SplitterFactory` to enumerate                                  |
| `VITE_CHAIN_ID`                     | no       | `84532`                    | Base Sepolia. Selects the viem chain and the currency config    |
| `VITE_RPC_URL`                      | no       | `https://sepolia.base.org` | **Required in practice** — the public node rate-limits          |
| `VITE_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS`          | no       | `5000`                     | Balance poll interval                                           |
| `VITE_IDENTITY_REGISTRY_ADDRESS`    | no       | known per chain            | ERC-8004 registry, for labelling rows with their agent          |
| `VITE_IDENTITY_REGISTRY_FROM_BLOCK` | no       | registry deploy block      | Start of the `agent_splitter` log sweep                         |
| `VITE_LOG_CHUNK_BLOCKS`             | no       | `500000`                   | Blocks per `eth_getLogs` call; lower it if the index is partial |
| `VITE_SHOW_DEMO_FLOW`               | no       | `false`                    | Enables `/devcon` and `/claim-wallet`. `"true"`/`"false"` only  |
| `VITE_DEMO_FLOW_BASE_URL`           | no       | `window.location.origin`   | Base URL the demo QR encodes; only read when the flag is on     |
| `VITE_DEVCON_API_URL`               | no       | —                          | `agent-orchestration-api` base URL for `/claim-wallet`          |

`VITE_RPC_URL` is not in the original spec for this dashboard but is not optional in reality:
`VITE_CHAIN_ID` selects a chain, it does not provide a transport. Mirror the wording of
`erc8004-dashboard/.env.example`, which already documents the rate-limit failure mode.

Validate all of it once at startup in `src/config/env.ts` and fail loudly with a readable message.
A dashboard that renders empty because `VITE_TREASURY_ADDRESS` was unset is worse than one that
refuses to boot.

## Agent identity

Seller rows are labelled with the ERC-8004 agent that owns the clone. The binding is **Identity
Registry metadata** under the `agent_splitter` key (`AGENT_SPLITTER` in
`erc8004-adapter/src/constants.ts`), written by the `link_split_contract` MCP tool.

It is deliberately **not** stored in the clone. `createSplitter` is permissionless, so an agentId
held by the factory would be a claim anyone could make about anyone; the registry already gates
`setMetadata` on NFT ownership. And clone terms are frozen at `initialize` while agent NFT
ownership can transfer, so a binding baked into the clone would decay into a lie with no way to
correct it. Do not add `agentId` to `RevenueSplitter` or `SplitterFactory`.

Because `MetadataSet` indexes the metadata key, the whole splitter → agent reverse index is one
`eth_getLogs` call rather than a crawl over every Agent Card.

**A claim is not proof.** Any agent owner can name any address, so `lib/agents.ts` verifies before
the badge says "verified":

1. the claimed splitter is in the factory registry (claims on unknown addresses are discarded), and
2. the clone's frozen `seller` is the agent's registered wallet (`getAgentWallet`) or its NFT owner
   (`ownerOf`).

Anything else renders as `unverified`, and two agents claiming one clone renders as `disputed` —
never silently resolved in favour of whichever log came last.

**A failed read is not a finding.** `unverified` means the registry answered and the wallets do
not match. A read the node failed — a 429, a timeout — says nothing about the agent, so `tryRead`
tells a revert (absence: normal) from any other error (unknown), and an agent whose check could
not complete keeps the link the previous sweep established, or shows `unchecked` ("checking…",
neutral, not a warning) when there is none. The index is marked `incomplete` and the context
sweeps again in 10s. Likewise, a claim sweep cut short by a node error keeps the previous links
it did not reach rather than dropping them.

Three constraints on this feature, all load-bearing:

- **It is optional.** No registry for the chain, an unreachable node, or a failed sweep must leave
  balances rendering normally. It is labelling, not data.
- **A partial sweep proves nothing.** The log scan is chunked and gives up rather than throwing; when
  it is cut short, rows show no "No agent linked" text, because absence is no longer evidence.
- **This package stays viem-only.** It does not import `@solarpunk/erc8004-adapter` (ethers, plus
  bee-js). `lib/agents.ts` declares a five-entry viem ABI subset of the registry instead — the
  "no ABIs here" rule is about the splitter contracts, which still go through the SDK.

### Agent names

The badge shows the agent's name from its Agent Card: `tokenURI(agentId)` gives the card's
location, which `refreshSwarmData` fetches with a plain `fetch` (an https feed URL is used as-is;
`bzz://` is resolved through `VITE_SWARM_GATEWAY_URL`).

This is the one place the package reaches outside the chain — there is still **no Bee dependency**,
just an HTTP GET. Treat it as unreliable by construction: the gateway is not ours, CORS may reject
the request, a cold feed may not resolve, and it may simply be slow. So:

- The card pass runs **after** the on-chain index has already been rendered, never before. The
  badge must never wait on a gateway.
- Every failure path returns undefined and the badge falls back to the bare agent id. A missing
  name is a degraded label, never a missing agent.
- One fetch per distinct agent, not per row, with an 8s abort — the same agent can hold several
  clones. Kept five minutes, a miss retried three times (see _Data flow → Refresh_).

The same fetch also yields the card's `image`, which the Map of Agents paints as the node. It is
resolved through `resolveCardUrl` like the card's own location, so it follows http(s) and `bzz://`
and nothing else — a `data:` or `javascript:` URL out of a third-party card is dropped rather than
handed to a renderer.

### Catalog link

The same card fetch yields the catalog link. The feed owner is the `endpoint` of the card's
`swarm-ai-catalog` service entry — a bare EOA, deliberately a different key from the card's own
feed signer, so it cannot be derived from the card's location.

The link is `<gateway>/bzz/<manifest root>/catalog.jsonld` — the collection document itself, on
`VITE_SWARM_GATEWAY_URL`. Getting there takes two hops, and only the second is a destination:

1. `GET <gateway>/feeds/<owner>/<CATALOG_FEED_TOPIC>` returns the feed's payload, which is the
   Mantaray root and nothing else — a bare 64-char hex string, per the spec's §4.1 invariant.
   Anything that does not match that shape is treated as no catalog rather than interpolated.
2. `/catalog.jsonld` under that root is the collection document (`CATALOG_MANIFEST_PATH` in
   `swarm-catalog/src/paths.ts`).

Do not link at the feed URL: it resolves to the root hex string, not to a catalog. Do not link at
`catalogue-feed-browser` either — `?owner=` was the old shape, and it presumes a second server is
running next to the dashboard.

`CATALOG_FEED_TOPIC` is the fixed protocol constant `keccak256("swarm-ai-catalog.v1")`, mirroring
`swarm-catalog/src/feeds.ts` — do not derive it per chain or per agent.

The catalog is resolved by the same pass as the card (`refreshSwarmData`, right after it) and
lands on the link as `AgentLink.catalog`; `CatalogLink` only reads it, and fetches nothing. So
the link arrives a beat after the row — same rule as the agent name: never block a row on a
gateway. Results are cached per gateway+owner (one read per catalog, not per row) with the same
five-minute / three-retry policy as cards, so a later publish still turns up. A local Bee usually has to be the gateway here: a
catalog published locally does not exist on `api.gateway.ethswarm.org`.

`CatalogLink` renders **nothing** when no feed owner resolved or the feed does not resolve, rather
than a dead link. A seller can legitimately hold a splitter and publish no catalog, and from here
that is indistinguishable from a card that failed to fetch.

When the feed **does** name a root, `resolveCatalog()` makes a third request for `catalog.jsonld`
itself, and a non-2xx answer renders **"Catalog unavailable"** instead of a link. The feed (one
chunk) outlives the catalog it points at: once the postage batch that stamped the catalog expires,
the gateway 404s the document while the feed still names it. The seller did publish one, so saying
so beats hiding it. An unavailable result is kept on screen but retried like a miss, so a
re-stamped catalog turns up without a reload.

**A click opens the catalog in a panel, not a tab.** `JsonDocumentDialog` fetches `catalog.jsonld` and
shows it pretty-printed in a native `<dialog>` (`showModal()`: backdrop, focus containment and
Escape come free; a backdrop click also closes it), with a "raw JSON" link to the file itself. The
pill stays a real `<a href>` and only a plain left click is intercepted, so a modified or middle
click and "copy link address" behave as a link — the same contract as `linkTo`.

`JsonView` highlights by what JSON-LD readers care about: `@` keywords (`@context`, `@type`) in
`lav`, ordinary keys in `sky`, the namespace of a compact IRI (`swarm-cat:`) dimmed so the term
leads, strings `mint`, numbers `warning`. It is built from React elements — a catalog is
third-party content, so never `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` — and its text is valid JSON when copied.
Documents are capped at 256 kB.

**Waiting is shown as waiting.** While a document loads, the panel shows pulsing dots and
"Loading from Swarm…". The time limit is a generous 45s, because a feed lookup on a public gateway is
often slow and a short limit turned slow-but-working into an error. An abort from the effect's own
cleanup (a closed panel, or React's development double-run) is never reported as a timeout. A
real failure says why and offers **Try again**. The Agent Card opens **instantly** from the copy
the badge already fetched (`AgentCardInfo.document`) and refreshes in the background; a failed
refresh leaves that copy on screen.

**The Agent Card opens the same way.** The badge's card icon uses `JsonDocumentDialog` too, kicker
"Agent card · ERC-8004 registration". Cards are usually served from a **feed**, which can change,
so a card is cached only when its URL is a content-addressed `/bzz/<ref>/` path (`immutable`); a
catalog always is. The dialog resets inherited text styles, because the card link sits inside the
badge pill and a top-layer dialog still inherits from its DOM parent.

## Explorer links

Do not hardcode `sepolia.basescan.org` — the chain is configurable, so the explorer must be too.
Derive it from the viem chain (`chain.blockExplorers.default.url`) and build
`${explorer}/address/${address}`. Every address in the UI (treasury, seller, clone) gets the same
external-link affordance: `target="_blank"`, `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

## Package layout

Mirror `erc8004-dashboard` so someone who knows one knows the other:

```

    usePolling.ts           — interval + document.hidden pause
    useTxLifecycle.ts       — shared idle/signing/pending/confirmed state machine
    useDistribute.ts        — one clone; wraps useTxLifecycle

    HistorySection.tsx      — Activity: filters, partial-sweep banner
    HistoryTable.tsx        — purchase/payout rows
    AddressLink.tsx         — any 0x value + copy + explorer icon; kind="tx" links a hash to
                              /tx/ rather than /address/. Used by every section
    AgentBadge.tsx          — the seller's ERC-8004 agent, with its verification status
    Balance.tsx             — formatUnits + symbol, with a skeleton state
    TxNote.tsx              — renders the tx state machine; shared by both buttons
    DistributeButton.tsx
    DistributeAllButton.tsx — treasury-level batch sweep
    ConnectButton.tsx
```

The reads live in `lib/`, not `hooks/`, on purpose: they are plain async functions, and a
`useBalances` hook would invite rows to call it and quietly break the single-fetch-owner rule.

One context owns all fetching. Do not let individual rows poll independently — that is how `3N`
requests become `3N` uncoordinated timers.

## Vite config

Copy `erc8004-dashboard/vite.config.ts` and adjust:

- Alias `@solarpunk/contracts` → `../contracts/ts/index.ts`, so the app runs against source with no
  build step (the same trick the sibling uses for `erc8004-adapter`).
- `server: { port: 5174 }` — `erc8004-dashboard` occupies the default 5173, and root `pnpm dev`
  runs every package in parallel.
- `appType: 'spa'` — the default, stated explicitly because the path router depends on it. See
  _Routing → Hosting_; it is what makes `/map` work in `dev` and `preview`, and it is also why
  neither of those catches a static host that is missing the same rule.
- No `@ethersphere/bee-js` externalization and no `dotenv` mock are needed; this package touches
  neither.

## package.json

```json
{
  "name": "@solarpunk/marketplace-ui",
  "private": true,
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc && vite build",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@solarpunk/contracts": "workspace:*",
    "react": "^18.3.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.0",
    "react-force-graph-2d": "^1.29.1",
    "viem": "^2.21.0"
  }
}
```

`react-force-graph-2d` pulls `force-graph` and `react-kapsule`. Keep `react-kapsule` at **2.6.0 or
later**: that is the release with the React 18 StrictMode double-mount fix, and below it the canvas
fails to re-initialise on a remount.

Match `erc8004-dashboard`'s devDependencies exactly (`@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`,
`@vitejs/plugin-react`, `typescript`, `vite`) so the two stay on one toolchain.

## Presentation polish

This is built to be demoed. The states that get skipped and then bite on stage:

- **Loading** — skeleton rows on first load, never a flash of zeros. A real zero and an unloaded
  value must never look the same.
- **Empty registry** — `splitterCount === 0` is the normal state on a fresh factory. Say so
  ("No sellers have deployed a splitter yet"), do not render an empty table.
- **RPC failure** — a failed tick must not blank the table. Keep the last good values, mark them
  stale, and show the error out of the way.
- **Address rendering** — truncate as `0x1234…abcd` with the full value in `title`, and make it
  copyable. Never wrap a full address mid-row.
- **Partial batch failure** — after a sweep that reports skips, a skipped row must be visually
  distinguishable from a row that was never swept. Otherwise the operator cannot tell what
  happened, and a half-finished payout looks identical to a finished one.
- **Numbers** — right-align, tabular figures (`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`), fixed decimal
  places so values do not jitter on each 5s tick.
