/**
 * The agent network, derived from data the dashboard already loads.
 *
 * Nothing here fetches. MarketplaceContext remains the single fetch owner; this is a second
 * reading of the same registry, agent links and log sweep the Dashboard renders as tables.
 *
 * The model is "one address, one node". A splitter clone is plumbing, not an actor: an agent's
 * clone, its seller EOA, its registered agent wallet and its NFT owner are all the same
 * participant, so they collapse onto a single node keyed by the clone. Without that collapse an
 * agent that both sells and buys renders as two disconnected dots — precisely the relationship
 * this view exists to show.
 *
 * Every key is a lowercased address. This is not cosmetic: `bySplitter` is keyed lowercase
 * (agents.ts), a purchase's `splitter` is a decoded log arg and therefore checksummed, and a
 * payout's is `log.address` and therefore not. Mixing them joins one kind of row and silently
 * drops the other.
