/**
 * Publish the built dashboard to Swarm.
 *
 * `pnpm run deploy` is `pnpm build` followed by this: it uploads `dist/` as a single Swarm
 * collection and prints the URLs the result is reachable at.
 *
 * Four things here are load-bearing rather than incidental:
 *
 * - **Index and error document both point at `index.html`.** The router uses real paths
 *   (`/map`, `/claim-wallet`), so a cold GET at a deep path has to serve the app instead of
 *   404ing — this is Swarm's equivalent of nginx's `try_files`. `/claim-wallet` is the one
 *   that must not break: it is reached by a phone scanning a QR code, in front of an audience,
 *   with no client-side code running to recover.
 * - **Only the subdomain URL can be shared.** Under `<gateway>/bzz/<ref>/` the app is served
 *   from a sub-path while the built `index.html` references `/assets/…` absolutely, so the
 *   bundle 404s before the router even loads. `<cid>.bzz.link` serves it at the root, which is
 *   what `base: '/'` in `vite.config.ts` assumes. That form takes the CID rather than the hex
 *   reference because a DNS label caps at 63 characters and a hex reference is 64.
 *
 *   It is still not public on its own: bzz.link **allowlists raw hashes** and shows an approval
 *   form until a given one is cleared, per hash, so every redeploy needs another approval. A
 *   hash reached through an ENS name is never gated. Verify deploys against your own node,
 *   which has no allowlist — that is why its URL is printed first.
 * - **Uploads are not deferred by default.** A deferred upload returns as soon as the local
 *   Bee node holds the data, before it has pushed any of it to the network — so the script
 *   would report success on content a public gateway cannot yet resolve, which is exactly the
 *   failure that only shows up when someone else scans the code. Waiting is slower and honest.
 * - **A deploy is immutable.** The reference is the hash of the content, so nothing here
 *   overwrites anything: a re-deploy is a new address, and the old one stays retrievable for
 *   as long as its stamp lives. Every `VITE_*` value compiled into the bundle is frozen at
 *   that address too — see the pre-flight warnings below.
 *
 * **A stable address comes from a feed, not from the upload.** With `SWARM_FEED_PK` set, each
 * deploy also writes its reference as the next update of one feed — fixed owner (that key),
 * fixed topic (`SWARM_FEED_TOPIC`) — and prints the feed manifest over it. The feed manifest's
 * reference is a function of owner and topic alone, so it never changes: set it as the ENS
 * contenthash once, and every later deploy moves the name by moving the feed, with no ENS
 * transaction. Losing or rotating the key means a new feed, a new manifest and a new contenthash.
 *
 * Configuration comes from the environment or `.env`, deliberately **without** a `VITE_`
 * prefix: Vite inlines every `VITE_*` var into the bundle, and a postage batch id is a
 * spending credential — a feed signer key even more so. Vite ignores these, which is the point
 * of the naming.
